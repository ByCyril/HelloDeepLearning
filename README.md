# HelloDeepLearning

To run the code, please make sure you run this in a virtual environment. You can set up your own here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

You will also need Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow, Numpy, and Matplotlib. 

Feel free to reachout to me if you have any questions about the repo!
